# Goals
An RFC which embraces the history/similarity/familiarity of MT-Safe  (Thread-oriented,single JVM) java.util.concurrent Executor framework.
Empowering end-users with a brand new IPC-safe (Process-oriented, grid-oriented, multiple JVMs ) capability.

## Initial Description
*Comment This needs to be made more language and library neutral to describe the requirement that any compliant library could support.*

OpenHFT RFC:     Chronicle IPC-Safe IPC-Savvy Executor Framework

This RFC calls for the delivery of a Chronicle API -- which embraces the history/similarity/familiarity of MT-Safe  (Thread-oriented,single JVM) java.util.concurrent Executor framework --   empowering OpenHFt end-users with a brand new IPC-safe (Process-oriented, grid-oriented, multiple JVMs )  capability.

E.g.   Just as today's j.u.c API you can configure a single JVM with a BlockingQueue-backed ThreadPoolExecutor that manages the dispatch and harvesting of FutureTasks with MT-safe concurrency, the new OpenHFT API will empower the Chronicle capability to configure a grid of multiple  JVMs with a ChronicleBlockingQueue-backed ChronicleGridPoolExecutor that manages the dispatch and harvesting of ChronicleFutureTaks (ChronicleCallable, ChronicleRunnable) with IPC-safe, IPC-savvy concurrency.
