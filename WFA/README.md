# Goals
WFA is designed to be high level description for Wire Formats to comply with.  Any Wire Format which complies with this RFC can be accessed through the same API.

The intent of the API is to produce a wire format which is;
 - human readable (or can be converted to a human readble format),
 - cross platform
 - resilient to schema changes in the data encoded.
